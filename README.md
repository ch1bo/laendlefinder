# LeandleFinder

A hobby project to collect historical real estate sales data from Vorarlberg and visualize it on OpenStreetMap.

> [!WARNING]
> This is fully vibe coded.. Don't judge me for code quality!

## Project Components

1. **Data Scraper**: Collects and stores real estate sales data (Rust)
2. **Map Visualization**: Displays the data on OpenStreetMap (JavaScript)

## Usage

### Running the Scraper

The unified `laendlefinder` executable runs both scrapers sequentially:

**Run all scrapers:**
``` shell
cargo run
```

**Run with custom options:**
``` shell
cargo run -- --max-pages 3 --output my_properties.csv
```

**Run only vol.at scraper (sold properties):**
``` shell
cargo run -- --skip-laendleimmo
```

**Run only laendleimmo.at scraper (available properties):**
``` shell
cargo run -- --skip-vol
```

**Individual scrapers (backwards compatibility):**
``` shell
cargo run --bin vol-scraper
cargo run --bin laendleimmo-scraper
```

### Using Authentication with Cookies

Some websites require authentication to access their content. You can provide cookies from your browser session:

1. Visit the target website (vol.at) in your browser and log in if required
2. Open browser developer tools (F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect)
3. Go to the "Network" tab
4. Refresh the page
5. Click on any request to the website
6. In the request headers, find the "Cookie" header
7. Copy the entire cookie string
8. Save it to a file named `cookies.txt` in the project root directory
9. Run the scraper with: `cargo run cookies.txt` (or specify a different path)

### Running the Web Visualization

After running the scraper, or if you have a `properties.csv` file:

``` shell
simple-http-server web -i -o
```

This will start a local server and automatically open the visualization in your browser. The map displays property markers on OpenStreetMap with clickable popups showing property details.

## Project Status

This project is in the "Dirt Road" phase - the initial implementation to prove the concept works.

See the [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) file for the full development plan.
