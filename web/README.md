# LeandleFinder Web Visualization

This directory contains the web visualization component of the LeandleFinder project.

## Overview

The web visualization displays real estate property data on an OpenStreetMap using Leaflet.js. It reads property data from a CSV file generated by the Rust scraper component.

## Features

- Displays property markers on an OpenStreetMap
- Shows property details in popups when markers are clicked
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices

## Usage

### Starting the Visualization

There are several ways to view the visualization:

1. **Simple method**: Open `index.html` directly in your web browser
   - Note: Some browsers may block local file access for security reasons

2. **Using a local server** (recommended):
   - Python simple server:
     ```
     # Navigate to the project root directory
     cd /path/to/leandlefinder
     
     # Start a simple HTTP server (Python 3)
     python -m http.server
     
     # Then open http://localhost:8000/web/ in your browser
     ```
   
   - Node.js with http-server:
     ```
     # Install http-server if you haven't already
     npm install -g http-server
     
     # Navigate to the project root directory
     cd /path/to/leandlefinder
     
     # Start the server
     http-server
     
     # Then open http://localhost:8080/web/ in your browser
     ```

3. **Using VS Code Live Server extension**:
   - Install the "Live Server" extension
   - Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have run the scraper to generate the `data/properties.csv` file before opening the visualization.

## Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the map and JavaScript code

## Dependencies

- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/): For map visualization
- [PapaParse](https://www.papaparse.com/): For CSV parsing
- [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/): For map tiles

## Troubleshooting

- **CSV file not loading**: Ensure the `data/properties.csv` file exists in the correct location relative to the web directory
- **CORS errors**: If you see CORS-related errors in the console, you need to use a local server instead of opening the file directly
- **Map not displaying**: Check your internet connection as the map tiles require online access

## Future Improvements

See the project roadmap for planned improvements to the visualization component.
