# LeandleFinder Web Visualization

This directory contains the web visualization component of the LeandleFinder project.

## Overview

The web visualization displays real estate property data on an OpenStreetMap using Leaflet.js. It reads property data from a CSV file generated by the Rust scraper component.

## Features

- Displays property markers on an OpenStreetMap
- Shows property details in popups when markers are clicked
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices

## Usage

1. Make sure you have run the scraper to generate the `data/properties.csv` file
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. The map will automatically load and display property markers

## Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the map and JavaScript code

## Dependencies

- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/): For map visualization
- [PapaParse](https://www.papaparse.com/): For CSV parsing
- [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/): For map tiles

## Future Improvements

See the project roadmap for planned improvements to the visualization component.
